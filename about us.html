Start free trialYour About Us page is one of the first supporting pages you’ll likely design when building your website, regardless of the industry you’re in.

It may go by different labels—About, Story, Mission—but these types of pages serve the same key purpose: to be the page for a brand to say, “This is who we are.”

When a visitor wants to learn more about you or your business, the About page is what they’ll look for.

What is an About Us page?
An About Us page is a section on a website that provides information about a company, organization, or individual. It is an opportunity to tell your brand’s story, share your vision, history, values, and achievements, and introduce team members. This is where you build trust and credibility with customers.

In Shopify’s customer trust research, we found shoppers navigate to an About Us page to learn more about the brand and the people behind the products. Your About Page should address those two curiosities shoppers have to help them with decision making. 

Shoppers are also interested in a company’s mission. They’ll use the About Us page to determine if they share core values with the business and to decide if they want to shop with you or not. 

Components of an About Us page
In contrast to a landing page, your About Us page should focus more on your brand identity and less on sales. Here are some components to include:

Your brand story. Tell shoppers the origin story of your business and why you started it. For the most impact, make it memorable and personal, so customers relate and connect with your brand.
Who you serve. What do you offer and who is it for? Help shoppers see the value of your product or service by sharing how it solves problems or needs.
How you operate. If you offer a service, explain your business model or how your products are made. If you have a unique way of doing things, show it. This builds credibility with shoppers and helps you stand out against competitors.
The face of your business. Feature photos of the founders or key people on your team. Customers like to see who they are buying from or working with.
Persuasive content. Consider what step you’d like readers to take next. Use additional content and calls to action to move them forward towards that goal. This could include buttons, testimonials, an explainer video, data visualizations, links to blog posts, products, your social media accounts or newsletter.
Your About Us page is going to be about you, but that doesn’t mean you can’t borrow some ideas from others, especially when it comes to structure and design.

The following are examples of different ways you can tackle your About Us page design.

When in doubt, start with a question. That’s exactly what Magic Spoon—a brand that creates healthy cereals for grownups—does with the introductory paragraph on its About Us page. 

Want to take it to the next level? Start your About page with a question that pulls on your audience’s emotions. The makers of Magic Spoon pose an effective first question that makes you think: 

“Remember the carefree days of childhood, when you didn’t feel guilty about eating mountains of cereal with questionable nutrition?”

Don’t be afraid to use bright, fun colors on your About Us page (assuming they’re part of your brand identity) to make your brand more memorable. Where Magic Spoon really shines is its comparison chart. It gives you a clear visual of how its cereal compares to the competition. 

Plus, Magic Spoon’s copy is relatable to its audience. Why sound like a stiff corporate welcome packet when you don’t have to?

2. WP Standard
WP Standard’s About Us page is almost like a look book with a minimal amount of copy. The story is told through video, imagery, and sparse text that summons the idea of resilience, exploration, and embracing the essential.

n a way, its About Us page is more of an “about the customer” page that allows shoppers to explore and connect through its video, before bringing it back to its promise as a company.

It’s a departure from copy-driven pages, but it works in the favor of WP Standard as a brand of few words, or for brands that want to say a lot by saying very little.

3. BRADY
Going along with the same storytelling theme, BRADY capitalizes on the effect that telling a story—with its own angle and personality—can create for a brand. 

Everything on its About Us page—from the simple black-and-white format to the images—screams quality and innovation. As you craft your About Us story, consider infusing it with your brand personality by using different branding elements. Bonus points if you can sprinkle in reasons why your customers should trust your brand over others. BRADY does this by stating its focus is on producing the world’s “finest performance brand.” 

Do the same and your About Us page has already done half its job.

BRADY’s About Us page goes on to explain why it’s valuable: “Our fabrics and materials fuse natural elements with cutting-edge technology. Designed with the body in mind.”
4. Bossy Cosmetics
Bossy Cosmetics’ About Us page takes a more traditional approach, with plenty of text. Yet what’s worth noting is that it sets the picture of its founder front and center.

The founder is an integral part of the brand’s origin story, so making her the star of the page works. Think about including additional elements, like Bossy has, that can strengthen your About Us page, such as:

Brand-related Instagram posts
A welcome YouTube video
Links to partner charities and brands
Pictures of customers using your product
Interactive timelines that show company milestones
When you craft your About page, don’t forgo creativity for the sake of being professional, especially if that isn’t a value your brand stands for. What matters is that your brand is relatable to its target audience and meets them where they’re at.

5. Allbirds
Allbirds’ brilliant use of elements like background videos and quippy phrases to draw in its audience’s attention already make its About Us page that much more memorable. Scroll further and you’re met with a founder's story, told in the third person.

While this approach can work, be careful not to sound too stiff and unrelatable. To balance that, Allbirds uses simple copy and puts a face with a name by including images of its founders. 

Consider using animation to show instead of tell how your product comes together. Add an easy-to-skim description of how your product stands out from the rest for some additional context.

6. Buck Mason
Buck Mason—a menswear brand—doesn’t shy away from images to showcase the soul and origins of its California roots. It’s a great example of how you can use visuals to tell your story and create a brand identity that goes beyond the usual wall of text. 

One of the best parts of Buck Mason’s About Us page? Its calls to action (CTAs): “Come have a drink” and “Stop on by.” They’re relatable and playful, and they sound like their target audience. 

Don’t ignore your CTA as a key part of your About Us page that can add to your brand identity. It’s an opportunity to convey what your brand is all about.

7. Iya Foods
The clearer you can explain what you do—and the problem your product solves—the better off you’ll be. Iya Foods nails it with the introductory sentence on its About page: “To share love through good food.”

Iya Foods shares its mission on its About Us page.

As a heart-centered brand that cares about its global impact, Iya Foods emphasizes that key part of its brand in its mission statement. Describing your brand values and what you stand for is one of the best ways to connect with your audience. 

This approach doesn’t have to be boring. Add ingredients that showcase what makes your brand great. 

Iya Foods effectively uses images, its social media links, and even the notable publications it’s been featured in, giving it plenty of credibility.
